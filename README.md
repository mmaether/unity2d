# Unity 2D

This repo will hold all projects worked on for Udemy's [Complete C# Unity Developer 2D: Learn to Code Making Games](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/) course by Ben Tristem. I've always been interested with game development and design, and finally decided to take a stab at it.

I expect to include notes here for myself to reference, keeping everything maintained within the repo. There will be some obvious beginner notes here which I hope may be useful to look back at.
